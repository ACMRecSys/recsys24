# FAQ about RecSys’24 paper submission:

## 1. What article format should I use?
The submission format is different this year than in previous years. In particular, submissions for review now use a two-column format instead of the single-column format in previous years. This avoids problems and confusion, since in past years accepted papers had to be reformatted for publication.
## 4. What is the maximum length of the auxiliary material?
There is no restriction on the length of the auxiliary material. This material should provide details on the paper that enhance preproducibility (e.g., proof details, experiment details). Furthermore, this material may help reviewers understand the paper, but reviewers are not required to read it and the auxiliary material is not considered peer reviewed. You may also submit video material and/or source code. To submit multiple files, please zip them before submitting.
## 5. The instructions mention “excluding references”. Does it also exclude appendices?
No, appendices are counted towards the paper length if they are included in the main paper, as opposed to the auxiliary material.
## 6. Are appendices allowed?
Yes, appendices are allowed, but counted towards the paper length. 
## 9. Is it allowed to have a submitted paper to a preprint repository such as Arxiv before the deadline submission?
ACM policy allows authors to deposit their articles in arXiv.  At the same time, we generally discourage authors from depositing the paper they are submitting to RecSys in the week before and after the submission deadline because some reviewers may subscribe to arXiv notifications and the notice could place the anonymity of your submission at risk.
## 10. What about papers previously published in workshops?
Papers published in workshop proceedings may only be submitted if the RecSys submission includes at least 30% new main contributions (experiments, results, models, approaches, findings); such papers must also reference the original workshop paper on the submission form (but not in the anonymized paper).  Note that many workshops do not have published proceedings; for those workshops, these restrictions do not apply.
## 11. Should the paper be anonymized? 
Yes, regular papers are peer-reviewed in a double-blind process, which means that all submissions must NOT include information identifying the authors or their organization.  This means that you should not only remove author names and affiliations from the top of the paper, but should remove identifying acknowledgements, artifacts in source code or non-public datasets, and system names;  and should take steps to avoid self-identification in the paper.  For example, instead of “this builds on our prior work [Chu 2018]” you might use “this builds on the work of Chu [2018].”  If necessary, you may also choose to blind references to you prior work (e.g., “this builds on our prior work [Blinded 2018]”) and leave them out of the reference list.  
## 12. What do I need to include in the paper when reporting on human subjects research?
ACM RecSys expects all authors to comply with ethical and regulatory guidelines associated with human subjects research, including research involving human participants and research using personally identifiable data.  Papers reporting on such human subjects research must include a statement identifying any regulatory review the research is subject to (and identifying the form of approval provided), or explaining the lack of required review.  Reviewers will be asked to consider whether the research was conducted in compliance with applicable ethical and regulatory guidelines.  
## 13. What should be included in the “ethical considerations” section of a paper?
We encourage authors to include a section addressing the potential ethical implications of their work. This section is optional, and should be included as appropriate. For example, authors may wish to discuss potential biases in their training data, fairness and diversity issues, consequences of unsuccessful recommendations, issues arising from the use of sensitive data, etc.  Authors may also wish to discuss the negative as well as positive implications of applying the algorithms, technologies, and findings of their work, such as more effective suggestive selling, more addictive media experiences, etc.
## 14.  What does ACM RecSys expect in the way of reproducibility of research results?
The RecSys community deeply values reproducible and replicable research.  We particularly encourage authors to make algorithm details, source code, and datasets available for others to use both for replication and for future work.  We provide a list of datasets repository (https://github.com/ACMRecSys/recsys-datasets) and list of frameworks (https://github.com/ACMRecSys/recsys-evaluation-frameworks) that could be adopted to reproduce yours and previous results. As a community we also recognize the challenges faced by industry researchers who may make discoveries based on confidential data (and the similar challenges of research on private human subjects data).  Accordingly, we encourage such researchers to consider including a small replication test of their results on a publicly available dataset whenever possible.  
## 15.  If my paper is accepted at RecSys, am I required to travel to the conference to present it?
All authors of papers submitted to ACM RecSys commit to presenting their work at the conference. In all cases, at least one author of each paper must register for the conference or their paper may be withdrawn from the conference proceedings.
